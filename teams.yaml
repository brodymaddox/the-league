# Team configurations for The League
# Each team has a unique ID, display name, and training parameters
#
# skill_level (0.0 to 1.0): Controls play quality during competition
#   1.0 = Always optimal moves (deterministic)
#   0.7 = 70% optimal, 30% random (more unpredictable)
#   Lower values create weaker teams that make more mistakes
